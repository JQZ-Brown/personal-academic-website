I'm a Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, Brown University and I work with [Dr. Ritambhara Singh](https://rsinghlab.org/). My research is about developing and applying **machine learning** methods to analyze **biological data**. In particular, my current research project focuses on estimating gene relationships from single-cell sequencing data of multiple studies.  

Before joining Brown, I received my bachelor's degree in software engineering at Southeast University, China. I worked there with [Dr. Beilun Wang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0105/c23024a257533/pagem.htm) mainly on developing statistical methods for graphical model structure estimation.
