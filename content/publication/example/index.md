abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a sparse Gaussian Graphical
  Model with a special graph topological structure and more than a million
  variables. Most previous scalable estimators still contain expensive
  calculation steps (e.g., matrix inversion or Hessian matrix calculation) and
  become infeasible in high-dimensional scenarios, where p (number of variables)
  is larger than n (number of samples). To overcome this challenge, we propose a
  novel method, called Fast and Scalable Inverse Covariance Estimator by
  Thresholding (FST). FST first obtains a graph structure by applying a
  generalized threshold to the sample covariance matrix. Then, it solves
  multiple block-wise subproblems via element-wise thresholding. By using matrix
  thresholding instead of matrix inversion as the computational bottleneck, FST
  reduces its computational complexity to a much lower order of magnitude
  (O(p2)). We show that FST obtains the same sharp convergence rate O(âˆš(log
  max{p, n}/n) as other state-of-the-art methods. We validate the method
  empirically, on multiple simulated datasets and one real-world dataset, and
  show that FST is two times faster than the four baselines while achieving a
  lower error rate under both Frobenius-norm and max-norm.
