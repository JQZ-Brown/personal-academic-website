    abstract = {Measurement of single-cell gene expression at different timepoints enables the study of cell development. However, due to the resource constraints and technical challenges associated with the single-cell experiments, researchers can only profile gene expression at discrete and sparsely sampled timepoints. This missing timepoint information impedes downstream cell developmental analyses. We propose scNODE, an end-to-end deep learning model that can predict in silico single-cell gene expression at unobserved timepoints. scNODE integrates a variational autoencoder with neural ordinary differential equations to predict gene expression using a continuous and nonlinear latent space. Importantly, we incorporate a dynamic regularization term to learn a latent space that is robust against distribution shifts when predicting single-cell gene expression at unobserved timepoints. Our evaluations on three real-world scRNA-seq datasets show that scNODE achieves higher predictive performance than state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate that scNODEâ€™s predictions help cell trajectory inference under the missing timepoint paradigm and the learned latent space is useful for in silico perturbation analysis of relevant genes along a developmental cell path.The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/rsinghlab/scNODE.},
