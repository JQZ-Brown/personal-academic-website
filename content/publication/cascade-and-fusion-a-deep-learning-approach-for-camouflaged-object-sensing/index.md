abstract: The demand for the sensor-based detection of camouflage objects widely
  exists in biological research, remote sensing, and military applications.
  However, the performance of traditional object detection algorithms is
  limited, as they are incapable of extracting informative parts from low
  signal-to-noise ratio features. To address this problem, we propose
  Camouflaged Object Detection with Cascade and Feedback Fusion (CODCEF), a deep
  learning framework based on an RGB optical sensor that leverages a cascaded
  structure with Feedback Partial Decoders (FPD) instead of a traditional
  encoderâ€“decoder structure. Through a selective fusion strategy and feedback
  loop, FPD reduces the loss of information and the interference of noises in
  the process of feature interweaving. Furthermore, we introduce Pixel
  Perception Fusion (PPF) loss, which aims to pay more attention to local pixels
  that might become the edges of an object. Experimental results on an edge
  device show that CODCEF achieved competitive results compared with 10
  state-of-the-art methods.
