This is the final project for *CS2470 Deep Learning*, collaborated with Atishy Jain ad Tassallah Amina Abdullahi. Diagnostic error is an increasing threat to public health that contributes to a higher mortality rate of patients than any other preventive hospital adverse event. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can support doctors to accurately predict infrequent diseases as well as common diseases.
